    Brief description

Welcome to my web portfolio

First I designed the web interface using XD Adobe. From there I can analyze the layouts arrangement. I use flexbox mostly. I made mobile phone first and Mobile Menu Section was a big challenge for me as it was completely different from Tablet and Desktop menu. After trying many ways I was able to handle the menu as well.

I think My Portfolio still has a few mistakes but I have been trying to improve it better through the lessons I have learned.
